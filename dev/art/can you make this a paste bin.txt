[10:06:05 PM] Matthew : well that can be heavily argued, but
[10:06:14 PM] Matthew : they made the move they had to
[10:06:18 PM] Matthew : they did need to do it
[10:06:18 PM] Samuel  : Jimquisition completely destroyed hailbits video
[10:06:33 PM] Samuel  : it was kind of funny how illogical his arguments were now that i think about it
[10:06:43 PM] Matthew : why do you call him halibut, thats his channel name but he goes by totalbiscuit
[10:06:49 PM] Samuel  : dont know
[10:06:55 PM] Samuel  : :/
[10:09:03 PM] Matthew : everybody is going to have different opinions on the matter, i still think that the sale of games that dont get paid to the developers isint quite right
[10:09:14 PM] Matthew : and its not that the used game market itself hurts the industry
[10:09:25 PM] Matthew : its what it allows the retailers to do that hurts it
[10:09:32 PM] Samuel  : yet the developers roll in the money
[10:09:33 PM] Samuel  : :/
[10:09:52 PM] Samuel  : games should not be 60 dollars, and you know how much a new game give to people like game stop?
[10:09:55 PM] Samuel  : 2 dollars
[10:10:05 PM] Samuel  : you know how much they make for selling a new -s3?
[10:10:07 PM] Samuel  : ps3*
[10:10:09 PM] Samuel  : 4 dollars
[10:10:21 PM] Samuel  : they are forced into a position where they HAVE to sell used games to be relavent
[10:10:28 PM] Samuel  : this is factual data
[10:10:40 PM] Matthew : but the amount they sell is ridiculous, they could make their money if they didint sell used games
[10:10:42 PM] Samuel  : also, the argument about "internet servers" was ludicrous
[10:10:56 PM] Samuel  : no, actually they could not
[10:11:15 PM] Matthew : they dont sell enough used games to profit only from that
[10:11:17 PM] Samuel  : and gamestop isnt forcing developers to sell exclusives
[10:11:22 PM] Samuel  : they are not bullying them
[10:11:25 PM] Samuel  : on the contrary
[10:11:31 PM] Samuel  : they are selling out exclusives to them
[10:11:37 PM] Matthew : well we actually have no real proof of that either way
[10:11:47 PM] Samuel  : and back to the server thingf
[10:11:56 PM] Samuel  : you bought the game, someone had to buy it new
[10:11:58 PM] Samuel  : the 1st time
[10:12:02 PM] Matthew : but gamestop does telemarket and bother its customers like mosquitos
[10:12:08 PM] Samuel  : weather or not they play for a month on the server or a year
[10:12:09 PM] Matthew : i get that
[10:12:11 PM] Samuel  : that is erellivent
[10:12:21 PM] Samuel  : that argument was the dumbest argument he made
[10:12:28 PM] Samuel  : seriously
[10:12:37 PM] Matthew : well to a certain extent it makes sense
[10:12:41 PM] Samuel  : how?
[10:12:52 PM] Samuel  : who plays the already paid game is irrelevant
[10:13:02 PM] Samuel  : its still being played
[10:13:07 PM] Samuel  : that slot has been paid for the 1st time
[10:13:18 PM] Samuel  : it doesnt matter who bought the used copy
[10:13:30 PM] Samuel  : because that used copy is already in the system as a sell
[10:13:40 PM] Samuel  : so its not a inflow of server useage
[10:13:56 PM] Matthew : well you just made two entirely seperate arguments
[10:14:00 PM] Samuel  : no i didnt
[10:14:23 PM] Samuel  : you are misreading my words then sir :P
[10:14:28 PM] Matthew : the fact is somebody that buys a used game did not pay the developer to use it
[10:14:35 PM] Samuel  : someone did tho
[10:14:40 PM] Samuel  : the original buyer
[10:14:46 PM] Samuel  : the next buyer is irrelevant
[10:14:48 PM] Matthew : it doesnt matter if the 1st slot was filled, the 2nd person is playing the game for free from the dev
[10:14:55 PM] Samuel  : because its already in the system as a player
[10:15:21 PM] Matthew : the next buyer is relevant, the server doesnt matter, the person is straight out playing the game without paying the dev
[10:15:39 PM] Samuel  : so if you bought halo 4 and played online for a month, then gave it to me, why should i pay EXTRA to the developers for that slot, you are not playing the game anymore
[10:15:40 PM] Matthew : its a form of piracy in my opinion, you are stealing the right to use the game from the dev
[10:15:52 PM] Samuel  : no you are not
[10:15:56 PM] Samuel  : that is utter bull shit
[10:15:58 PM] Matthew : its not a server matter
[10:16:01 PM] Matthew : forget the server costs
[10:16:16 PM] Samuel  : its not pirating because they didnt COPY the game
[10:16:22 PM] Matthew : you are playing the game without paying the people that made or published it, you are stealing it from the devs
[10:16:26 PM] Samuel  : the original owner doesnt play the server anymore
[10:16:26 PM] Samuel  : you do
[10:16:32 PM] Samuel  : there isnt a addition or subtraction
[10:16:38 PM] Samuel  : its just a change in who plays it
[10:16:48 PM] Samuel  : that slot has been bought
[10:16:49 PM] Matthew : the server cost does not matter
[10:16:54 PM] Matthew : thats not what im saying
[10:17:00 PM] Samuel  : who has the copy is completely irrelevant
[10:17:10 PM] Matthew : im saying you are taking the game from the dev without paying them
[10:17:15 PM] Samuel  : HOW?
[10:17:28 PM] Matthew : because you are not paying the dev you are paying a shop
[10:17:51 PM] Matthew : you are buying the game from somebody that did not make it
[10:17:53 PM] Samuel  : person A bought the game, Person A sells it to gamestop, game stop sells game to person B. person A is now not playing that game on the server, person B is
[10:17:55 PM] Matthew : you are stealing the money from the de
[10:17:58 PM] Matthew : dev*
[10:18:07 PM] Samuel  : thats not stealing money from the dev
[10:18:14 PM] Matthew : if you say server again, thats not relevant here
[10:18:15 PM] Samuel  : you obviosuly dont know how economics work
[10:18:27 PM] Samuel  : thats like saying selling a barbie doll at a garage sell is stealing hasbros money
[10:18:31 PM] Matthew : person b did not pay the dev to own the game though
[10:18:39 PM] Samuel  : yes but person A did
[10:18:41 PM] Samuel  : thats what matters
[10:18:46 PM] Samuel  : that copy has made what it was ment to make
[10:18:47 PM] Matthew : but person b is playing it for free
[10:19:00 PM] Samuel  : after it is sold, the person A should have all the right to do with what he wants with his property
[10:19:06 PM] Samuel  : they are not RENTING the god damn game
[10:19:09 PM] Samuel  : they OWN that game
[10:19:12 PM] Samuel  : to do what the ywish
[10:19:17 PM] Samuel  : after it is sold to person A
[10:19:32 PM] Samuel  : ANYTHING and i mean ANYTHING AFTER THAT does not effect the publisher one bit
[10:19:45 PM] Samuel  : it doesnt matter if he throws it in the trash
[10:19:50 PM] Samuel  : or sells it to someone else
[10:19:56 PM] Samuel  : it has already been sold once
[10:20:04 PM] Samuel  : it has served its purpose in the economy
[10:20:18 PM] Matthew : basically then piracy is ok right, because the first person bought the game, he is free to do what he wants with it, all the people taking it dont matter right
[10:20:30 PM] Samuel  : and no person b isnt playing for free, he exchanged CURENCY for that game by person a indirectly
[10:20:41 PM] Samuel  : that is copying
[10:20:43 PM] Samuel  : not sharing
[10:20:53 PM] Matthew : its just sharing files
[10:20:55 PM] Samuel  : no
[10:20:57 PM] Samuel  : fuck no
[10:20:58 PM] Samuel  : god
[10:21:04 PM] Samuel  : how are you NOT getting the point
[10:21:36 PM] Matthew : see, this is where the argument breaks because software markets dont work anywhere close to the way physical markets do
[10:21:40 PM] Samuel  : any goods sold to the consumers is theirs, they have the undeniable right to do what they want with that said obhject because its theirs
[10:21:51 PM] Matthew : and we are comparing game sales to physical markets
[10:21:52 PM] Samuel  : it doesnt matter if its "software"
[10:21:57 PM] Samuel  : you own that set of bytes
[10:22:01 PM] Samuel  : it works the same way
[10:22:11 PM] Samuel  : the thing is PEOPLE SHOULD BE
[10:22:15 PM] Samuel  : that is the biggest disconenct
[10:22:24 PM] Samuel  : "oh well its just software therefore it doesnt comply
[10:22:31 PM] Samuel  : that is the biggest crack of shit ever
[10:22:44 PM] Matthew : no, you cant compare these markets to other markets
[10:22:50 PM] Samuel  : you bought that set of bytes, its your for the taking
[10:23:02 PM] Samuel  : why not then mister phd in markets
[10:23:28 PM] Matthew : right you paid for the bytes, so why not let other people use those bytes to
[10:23:40 PM] Samuel  : but when you hand them the bytes
[10:23:45 PM] Samuel  :  YOU DONT HAVE THEM ANYMORE
[10:23:48 PM] Samuel  : they are the same bytes
[10:23:52 PM] Matthew : because physical items dont work like theoretical ones
[10:23:53 PM] Samuel  : they wernt duplicated
[10:23:58 PM] Samuel  : manpulated
[10:23:59 PM] Samuel  : at all
[10:24:07 PM] Samuel  : just like a physical item
[10:24:11 PM] Samuel  : it works the same way
[10:24:13 PM] Samuel  : EXACTLYT
[10:24:22 PM] Samuel  : its still o na disc
[10:24:29 PM] Samuel  : you dont move it off the disc
[10:24:38 PM] Samuel  : and if you do (xbox one) you cant play wit without the disc
[10:24:44 PM] Samuel  : its still a physical product
[10:24:59 PM] Matthew : but either way, you are playing that product without paying the people that made it
[10:25:12 PM] Matthew : and again, it doesnt work like a physical object
[10:25:17 PM] Samuel  : that is irrelevant like i said , because the 1st copy served its purpose
[10:25:43 PM] Samuel  : it doesnt matter if person A played the game for 2 years or if person A played 1 year and person B played 1 year
[10:25:50 PM] Matthew : the experience of playnig a game is in no way the same as touching a physical object
[10:25:54 PM] Samuel  : it s still 60 dollars originally, it did its purpose
[10:26:14 PM] Samuel  : after it is sold, the amount of play time is litteraly not a variable
[10:26:21 PM] Samuel  : that didnt change the original price did it? no
[10:26:24 PM] Samuel  : it still was sold
[10:26:32 PM] Samuel  : if its played or not, they dont care
[10:26:35 PM] Matthew : except that people get play time without the devs getting paid for it
[10:26:36 PM] Samuel  : they made their origianl planed money
[10:26:41 PM] Samuel  : any mroe than that is a plus
[10:26:44 PM] Matthew : its the same money loss as piracy
[10:26:49 PM] Samuel  : its NOT A MONEY LOSS
[10:27:03 PM] Matthew : yes, that person is money lost to the dev
[10:27:08 PM] Samuel  : HOW?
[10:27:15 PM] Samuel  : its like the same person
[10:27:16 PM] Matthew : because the person didnt pay the dev
[10:27:22 PM] Samuel  : the original person isnt a player anymore
[10:27:24 PM] Matthew : but its not the same person
[10:27:30 PM] Samuel  : it doesnt matter
[10:27:38 PM] Matthew : yes it does
[10:27:40 PM] Samuel  : HOW
[10:27:54 PM] Matthew : because one person IS NOT another person
[10:28:11 PM] Samuel  : PIRATING A and B have game USED GAMES A doesnt play the game anymore, B takes place of A by continueing the play process.
[10:28:15 PM] Matthew : the second person is getting the experience of the game without having paid the dev
[10:28:18 PM] Samuel  : HE TAKES HIS FUCKING PLACE
[10:28:22 PM] Samuel  : IT WAS STILL SOLD
[10:29:01 PM] Samuel  : he doesnt need to pay the dev for that SPECIFIC copy because that SPEIFIC copy served its purpose
[10:29:08 PM] Samuel  : by being sold at 60 dollars
[10:29:09 PM] Matthew : no, thats not how games work, games are theoretically a limited product, once one person "finishes" the game if he gives it to another person, that person gets to "finish" the game for free
[10:29:20 PM] Samuel  : if another person payed more money tot he devs for that SAME COPY
[10:29:23 PM] Samuel  : that hase NOT CHANGEd
[10:29:29 PM] Samuel  : than that copy raisies in vlaue
[10:29:34 PM] Samuel  : and it DOES NOT WORK THAT WAY
[10:30:07 PM] Samuel  : oh my god, no. just because he finished the game or not negates the fact that he already paid for that copy
[10:30:08 PM] Matthew : games are a solid exeperience, they are not in the majority of the sense fluid
[10:30:44 PM] Samuel  : ok so how about this
[10:30:49 PM] Samuel  : you pay 60 dollars for a game
[10:30:51 PM] Samuel  : you dont likke it
[10:30:52 PM] Samuel  : then wat
[10:30:58 PM] Samuel  : you are forced to have it forever>
[10:31:08 PM] Samuel  : because only YOU can enjoy the product sold to you>?
[10:31:24 PM] Matthew : ok, this is actually the best example i got here, not the best way to think about it but here, you pay a prostitue, then after you finish, you cant just give her to a friend to take for free, thats not how it works
[10:31:36 PM] Samuel  : AHAHAHAHAHA
[10:31:36 PM] Samuel  : no
[10:31:42 PM] Samuel  : you dont own the prostitiute
[10:31:50 PM] Samuel  : you rent it
[10:31:59 PM] Matthew : but you dont have a right to "own" the game either
[10:32:04 PM] Samuel  : you dont rent games, you OWN THEM
[10:32:14 PM] Samuel  : WHAT!?!?!?!?!
[10:32:15 PM] Matthew : why do you think that you get to just own the game
[10:32:16 PM] Samuel  : oh no
[10:32:24 PM] Samuel  : you have turned to the dark side my friend
[10:32:29 PM] Matthew : what did you do to own it
[10:32:43 PM] Samuel  : you paid a monetary value for the interactive experience
[10:32:50 PM] Samuel  : just like any other experience in life
[10:33:00 PM] Samuel  : but in this case
[10:33:03 PM] Samuel  : its more like fine art
[10:33:09 PM] Samuel  : you paid for that to be hanged on your wall
[10:33:15 PM] Samuel  : for you to experience it when you want
[10:33:23 PM] Samuel  : if you dont want to experience that painting anymore
[10:33:25 PM] Samuel  : you sell it
[10:33:27 PM] Samuel  : or burn it
[10:33:30 PM] Samuel  : your choice
[10:33:44 PM] Matthew : but gaming isint a physical object
[10:33:59 PM] Samuel  : if i am going to throw away A PHYSICALL representation of a art piece i own, id rather give it to somoene else, for a monetary value
[10:34:06 PM] Matthew : and there is nothing denfiding "ownership" of data
[10:34:11 PM] Matthew : defining*
[10:34:13 PM] Samuel  : but its represented with a physical object
[10:34:14 PM] Samuel  : a disc
[10:34:20 PM] Samuel  : the disc is what you oen
[10:34:21 PM] Samuel  : own
[10:34:25 PM] Samuel  : you own that piece of plastic
[10:34:29 PM] Samuel  : its your property
[10:34:32 PM] Samuel  : you can break it
[10:34:34 PM] Samuel  : they dont care
[10:34:43 PM] Samuel  : you paid for that pice of plastic
[10:34:52 PM] Matthew : but the disc can just as easily be wiped then so it cant be used by another person, you still own the disc
[10:35:02 PM] Samuel  : you have the consitutional right under market law to sell that ownership
[10:35:08 PM] Samuel  : even SERVICE agrements are yours
[10:35:11 PM] Samuel  : you own the agreement
[10:35:12 PM] Matthew : but you dont own whats on it
[10:35:17 PM] Samuel  : i can if i like sell that agreement
[10:35:20 PM] Samuel  : its in the law
[10:35:36 PM] Samuel  : "you own the frame of the fine art piece but not the art on it"
[10:35:54 PM] Matthew : but the data on the disc isint physical
[10:36:15 PM] Samuel  : you have to understand wather its represented as some magnetic charges or some "data" that data is your property
[10:36:17 PM] Matthew : thats like trying to say you own a section of dark matter
[10:36:26 PM] Samuel  : its physically canging the magnetic poles of hte data
[10:36:31 PM] Samuel  : so those are yours
[10:36:52 PM] Matthew : but you bought the disc, not whats on it
[10:37:18 PM] Samuel  : inteletcual property is the biggest threat to freedom of information. Information should not be copyrighted. It is what grows economy's not stifles them. Dont let the big compies lie to you.
[10:37:28 PM] Matthew : this is why digital games cant be shared, because you dont own the data to do what you want with it
[10:37:37 PM] Samuel  : yes you do
[10:38:08 PM] Samuel  : when you buy a game on steam (thankfully) you are alowed to mod it as you wish because its your property. atleast valve had the decency to understand that
[10:38:19 PM] Matthew : no, because steam and origin both have banned users and they lose all their games, they just take them away and they are allowed to
[10:38:32 PM] Samuel  : it is physically represented on your hardrive as information you own
[10:38:51 PM] Matthew : because data is defined differently than phsyical objects beacuse it is theoretical
[10:38:58 PM] Samuel  : when your entertainment negates others (online hacking)that is against the rules
[10:39:01 PM] Samuel  : but offline?
[10:39:11 PM] Samuel  : how is hat information not yours?
[10:39:20 PM] Samuel  : by your logic Adobe owns everything i have made
[10:39:26 PM] Samuel  : in photoshop
[10:39:36 PM] Matthew : no, because you used their product to make your own
[10:39:42 PM] Samuel  : i USED it
[10:39:47 PM] Samuel  : USED it, manipulated it
[10:40:03 PM] Samuel  : used their tool "that you say i dont own" and made more information with theirs.
[10:40:08 PM] Matthew : and you paid to use it, when did this turn into a discusion about modding
[10:40:20 PM] Matthew : but the fact is you made your own data
[10:40:30 PM] Samuel  : because its another form of something you can do to something you OWN
[10:40:52 PM] Samuel  : if you dont own anything intelectually, then every bit of software on your computer is not actually yours
[10:41:03 PM] Samuel  : you are just borrowing the right to use it for a period of time
[10:41:10 PM] Samuel  : weather it be tomarrow or untill you die
[10:41:18 PM] Samuel  : but you say you are renting the service
[10:41:35 PM] Matthew : theoretically yes, but the companies choose to say you can use it forever
[10:41:41 PM] Samuel  : that is called product slavery my friend
[10:41:51 PM] Matthew : they choose to say that you can use their data
[10:41:55 PM] Matthew : but they have the right to say you cant
[10:42:01 PM] Samuel  : well obviosuly no litigimate logic will work with you so i am done.
[10:42:17 PM] Matthew : they have the right to say you cant use their data
[10:42:43 PM] Samuel  : after you purchaced it
[10:42:46 PM] Samuel  : right
[10:42:47 PM] Samuel  : ok
[10:43:07 PM] Matthew : you paid them for the time that they told you that you would have
[10:43:16 PM] Samuel  : they never set a time
[10:43:21 PM] Samuel  : seriosuly i am done
[10:43:24 PM] Samuel  : drop the subject
[10:43:24 PM] Samuel  : now
[10:43:35 PM] Matthew : alright, i need to go mow the lawn anyways
